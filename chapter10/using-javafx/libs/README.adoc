== JavaFX 11

JavaFx libraries were not only removed from the Oracle JDK, but they are no available on the Maven Central Repo.(They seem to be, but the jars uploaded there are empty)
So I downloaded them from the official site https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ and added them to the project, so it will compile no matter what.

OpenJFX is an open source, next generation client application platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems built on Java.
It is a collaborative effort by many individuals and companies with the goal of producing a modern, efficient, and fully featured toolkit for developing rich client applications.

The JavaFX SDK software is licensed under GPL v2 + Classpath (see http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html).
