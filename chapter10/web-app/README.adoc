== Web Application Demo

This module is quite unstable as Tomcat 9 was not really supporting Java 9 very well when this code sample was written.
This application was eventually compiled with Java 8, to make sure it is functional, but the module was taken out of the project,
as it was not compiling with Java 9+.

If you want to properly compile and run it, copy the web-app in a different location, replace build.gradle contens with
build.gradle-independent, and use Java 8.

If we are lucky and in works with Java 9+ by the time this book is released, the module will be added back to the project.
